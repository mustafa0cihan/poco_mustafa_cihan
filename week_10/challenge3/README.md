You can design it however you want, but the manager wants the button to
animate both on the :hover and the :active state.

1. Redesign the page (e.g. colors, positions, sizing, spacing)
2. Improve the button's hover effect
3. Improve the button's click effect

SKILLS:
color, background, margin, padding, border-radius, 
CSS pseudo selectors (:active, :hover), transform


STRETCH GOALS
============

1. Validate that it's an email the user has entered
2. Give feedback as to whether the form was successfully submitted or not
3. Go crazy with the error/success feedback (e.g. animations, sounds)
