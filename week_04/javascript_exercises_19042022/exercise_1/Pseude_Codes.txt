B - Age calculator
Want to find out how old you'll be? Calculate it!

Store your birth year in a variable.
Store a future year in a variable.
Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values.
For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or 38, depending on what month it is in 2026.
Output them to the screen/console like so: "I will be either NN or NN in YYYY", substituting the values.

************************************************************************

Solving:

Constriction 
1) We will only get two variable values from the user : "birth year and future year"
2) Future year value must be greater than the year of birth
3) We will calculate his probable age only in years.
4) We should also consider the possibility that she/he may not have reached her/his new age in the next year.
5) Every variable must be integer.
6) Value must be entered for all variables. Otherwise, the user should be prompted to enter values for empty variables.

1) Start
2) Get user's birth year
3) Get user's a future year
4) Value must be entered for all variables. Otherwise, the user should be prompted to enter values for empty variables.
5) Check type of variables. If the type of variable values is not integer, ask the user to enter new values.
6) Check if the future year value is greater than your birth year. If not, request user to enter a larger value for next year variable
7) Subtract next year from the user's birth year.
8) Subtract the user's birth year and 1 year from the next year for cases where the user has not reached their new age.
9) Print the values from steps 4 and 5 to the user as possible age values for future year.
